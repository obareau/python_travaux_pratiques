# In Python, just as in most of the programming languages you must put any free text inside a pair of
# quote characters.
# Otherwise Python will try to find meaning in the text.1
# These pieces of texts are called “strings”.
# In Python you can put string between two single quotes: ‘’ or between two double quotes: “”. Which
# one does not matter.
